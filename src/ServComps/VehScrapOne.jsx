            <li>
              <h6>Environmental Protection</h6>
              <span>Reducing Pollution, Preserving Nature</span>
              <p>
              Old vehicles can be harmful to the environment, releasing pollutants and occupying
valuable space. Proper scrapping minimizes the environmental footprint, reducing
pollution and preventing resource wastage.

              <h6>Resource Recovery</h6>
              <span>"Recycling for a Sustainable Future"</span>
              <p>
              Vehicle scrapping allows for the recovery and recycling of valuable materials. Metals,
plastics, and other components are repurposed, reducing the need for new
resources and supporting sustainable practices.
